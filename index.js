/**
 * dsh-autorestart —cross-restart continuation for DeepSeek Harness.
 *
 * The plugin keeps a small durable checkpoint under `<DSH_HOME>/storages/dsh-autorestart/`
 * describing which sessions were in flight. After a host restart it:
 *   1. resumes the interrupted session's agent through `ctx.sessionController.resolveAgent`,
 *   2. re-arms a durable goal when the session had one (the goal round driver then
 *      starts the next round automatically), or
 *   3. injects one clearly-marked continuation prompt so the agent picks the work back up.
 *
 * It also registers tools the agent can call to request an idle-aware graceful restart
 * (`continuum_restart`), inspect the lifecycle (`continuum_status`) and cancel a pending
 * restart (`continuum_cancel_restart`).
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free: only Node builtins and relative modules, so a
 * profile-installed bundle resolves without any `@deepseek-ai/*` package links.
 *
 * @module dsh-autorestart

/**
 * THE FIRST-INSTALL BACKUP (user decision, 2026-10-30).
 *
 * A machine that has never restarted has no backup at all, so a boot that fails
 * after the plugin is installed has nothing to roll back to. The FIRST boot of a
 * NEW host process therefore seeds one known-good copy of the profile.
 *
 * Two rules keep it honest:
 *   - a plugin RELOAD is not an installation: `runtime.isNewBoot` must be true,
 *     and nothing is written on a reload;
 *   - a machine that already has a known-good copy gets no second seed.
 *
 * A failure is NOT silent: it is recorded on `runtime.firstInstallBackup` (and
 * in the checkpoint, so it survives the next boot) and the health route reports
 * it, because a machine with no backup must be able to say so.
 *
 * @param {object} runtime
 * @param {object} [config]
 * @param {{ profileDir?: string }} [overrides] the profile to copy (tests pass it)
 * @returns {Promise<object|null>} the record that was written (null = nothing to do)

 * files and six plugins, and silently skipped the seventh — `dsh-autorestart`
 * itself. The write really failed, and the reason is a hard Windows fact:
 *
 *   fs.cpSync(B4/node_modules-link/dsh-autorestart, <workspace>/plugins/dsh-autorestart,
 *             { recursive: true, force: true })
 *   → EIO, Access is denied. …\plugins\dsh-autorestart\assets
 *
 * — the running host holds its own plugin files. That cannot be forced, but it is
 * exactly the case that healing can wait for: the same write succeeds once the
 * process that held the files is gone.
 *
 * SO: a rollback records what it deferred (`deferredRestore` in the state file),
 * and the NEXT boot retries those entries ONE PLUGIN AT A TIME. Success clears the
 * record; a failure keeps it with the error it really got (and the health route
 * shows it), so "one plugin did not come back" is a fact somebody can read
 * instead of an absence.
 *
 * A reload is not a boot: nothing is retried in the same process, because the
 * files are held by that very process.

   * DISARM THE GOAL OF THE SESSION THAT ASKED FOR THE RESTART — AT ONCE.
   *
   * Real reading (restart-gate.json, 2026-11-02): a restart asked for by a
   * goal-driven session waited 39 minutes with `attempts: 0`. The gate was fine
   * — `action: "allow", reason: "no-agent-running", quietForMs: 12412` the
   * moment the root session really stopped. The deadlock was elsewhere: the goal
   * round driver starts the next round a few seconds after the last one ended,
   * so the 10-second settle window never filled. Waiting for "the busy session
   * to go idle" cannot work: between two rounds it IS idle, and the next round
   * starts first.
   *
   * So the disarm happens when the request is QUEUED, not when the gate finally
   * opens (by then the request has been waiting forever):
   *   - the round that is running right now still finishes normally;
   *   - no new round starts;
   *   - the quiet window fills, the gate allows, the restart happens;
   *   - after the restart the existing boot recovery re-arms the goal.
   *
   * A session WITHOUT a goal is untouched: `disarmGoal` answers `no-goal` and
   * nothing is written.

            //   - 配置可能在快照与这次探活之间被换过（还原、手改、别的写入者）。
            // 只要这两件事有任何一件发生，把重启前那份记成「探活成功时跑的就是这一份」，
            // 就是 12-04-33 那次事故的翻版（坏配置被认证，随后被「还原」覆盖回去）。
            // 所以这里和 app 模式那条（verifyRestartBoot -> decideBootCertification）用**同一条判据**：
            //   快照侧的指纹 == 此刻磁盘上这份配置的指纹，两侧都存在且相等才盖章。
            //   快照侧「没有记录值」不再自动等于「没证据」：meta 里没有就**现算一次**再比
            //   （`snapshotConfigFingerprint`，app 模式那条也用它，两条路径不许各写一套）。
            //   没指纹 ≠ 内容不对 —— 老备份只是当初没拍照，补拍一张再比，内容对不上才拒绝。
            // 判据本身在 lib/restart-verdict.js 里（decideProbeCertification），两处共用同一个比对函数，
            // 不许在这里另写一套——两条路径的口径一旦分叉，先坏的那条没人会发现。
            //
            // WHERE THE TWO SIDES COME FROM (为什么是这两个值，不是别的)：
            //   - 快照侧：`snapshotConfigFingerprint(backup.dir)` —— meta.json 里**当初记下**的指纹优先；
            //     没有（老备份，那份 meta 比这个字段还老）就**现算**：读副本自己的 `config/` 算一张。
            //     没指纹 ≠ 内容不对：当初没拍照，不等于内容可疑；文件还在就能补拍一张再比。
            //     不给它补，等于「升级一次就把用户手里那份能回退的备份全收走」——这是本插件最不该做的事。
            //     代价：早先刻意只读 meta，是为了防「事后被改过的副本自证」；现算让这层防护弱了一点
            //     （要同时把副本和现役配置改成同一份内容才能骗过，而那时「这份内容能起来」本来就是真的）。
            //     取舍写在这里的唯一出处：`snapshotConfigFingerprint` 的注释。
            //   - 现役侧：`profileConfigFingerprint(profileDir)`，读的是**这次运行所用的 profile 根目录**里的
            //     cordis.patch.yml / package.json / pnpm-lock.yaml。这个 `profileDir` 来自本函数的
            //     `snapshot.profileDir`，而它和 app 模式用的 `runtime.profileDir.dir`（getter 同样调用
            //     resolveProfileDirDetailed()）是**同一个解析器**的结果，所以两侧指的是同一个目录、同一个布局
            //     （profile 根目录，不是副本里的 config/ 子目录）。
            //   - 时机：command 模式下这段跑在**旧宿主进程**里（见上面 5746 附近那段注释），此刻磁盘上的配置
            //     就是新实例启动时读的那一份；之后若有人又写了配置，指纹就会不一致——那正是要拒绝的时候。

 *   true   a restore is on record and it happened during THIS restart;
 *   false  the recorders were read and none of them reports a restore — a real
 *          "no", not a shrug;
 *   null   nothing on disk can answer (no recorder has written yet, a report
 *          cannot be read, or this boot cannot say when it started). `null` is
 *          NEVER rounded down to `false`: "we do not know" is a different fact
 *          from "it did not happen", and the selector has to be able to tell
 *          them apart.

/**
 * THE FINGERPRINT OF THE CONFIGURATION THAT IS ON DISK **RIGHT NOW**.

 * WHY THIS EXISTS: certifying a copy asks ONE question — "is the content in the
 * snapshot the content this boot is running?" — and the snapshot side of that
 * answer is `contentFingerprintOf(snapshotDir)`, which reads
 * `<snapshot>/config/<name>`. The LIVE profile keeps the same three files at its
 * ROOT, so that reader cannot be pointed at it; reading the live profile is what
 * turns the comparison into a physical fact instead of a guess.
 *
 * WHY THE FORMAT IS REPEATED HERE instead of imported: the input stream belongs to
 * lib/backup.js (CONFIG_FILES, each hashed as name + length + content so two
 * different name/content splits can never produce the same stream). That module
 * is not part of this change, and copying the profile into a temporary tree just
 * to reuse the reader would write to disk on every boot. The two formats are
 * therefore PINNED TO EACH OTHER BY A TEST (test/certification-wiring.test.mjs,
 * "the drift guard"): if either side ever changes, that test fails instead of the
 * comparison quietly comparing apples with oranges.
 *
 * `null` — not a digest — when there is nothing to fingerprint: an unknown profile
 * directory, or one that holds NONE of the three files. A digest over
 * "everything missing" would equal the fingerprint of an empty copy and would
 * certify a boot that proved nothing at all.

 * THE SNAPSHOT SIDE OF THE FINGERPRINT COMPARISON — recorded, computed, or nothing.
 *
 * THE RULE THE USER SETTLED (2026-11-01, 升级用户不许丢救援能力):
 *
 *   没指纹 ≠ 内容不对。A copy whose meta.json was written before fingerprints
 *   existed is NOT suspicious — nobody took its picture, that is all. The
 *   fingerprint is computed FROM the file contents, so as long as the copy is
 *   still on disk it can be taken again, right now, and then compared. What the
 *   comparison refuses is CONTENT that differs, never AGE.
 *
 * WHY COMPUTING IS THE SECOND CHOICE AND NOT THE FIRST: a recorded fingerprint is
 * evidence from the moment of the copy; a computed one is the copy describing
 * itself. So `meta.json` wins whenever it has an answer, and the computation only
 * fills the gap an old copy leaves.
 *
 * WHAT COMPUTING GIVES UP (said out loud, not hidden): the earlier rule read the
 * meta ONLY, so a copy edited after the fact could not certify itself — it would
 * show the recorded value, which no longer matched anything. With a computed
 * fallback that protection is weaker: an old copy (no recorded value) that was
 * edited after the fact now gets a fingerprint of its EDITED content, and if that
 * content also happens to be what the host is running, it certifies. Fooling it
 * takes editing the copy AND the live profile to the same content — at which
 * point "this content boots" is true anyway, which is the whole claim a
 * certification makes. The trade is deliberate: it buys back "the upgrade does
 * not take away every booted copy a user had".
 *
 * NOTHING IS WRITTEN HERE. The computed value is used for THIS decision only and
 * is never stored back into the meta: the field in `meta.json` is "what was
 * recorded when the copy was taken", and writing a value into it afterwards would
 * turn "I computed this" into "this was witnessed", which is the difference
 * between evidence and a copy vouching for itself.
 *
 * "COULD NOT COMPUTE" IS NOT "CONTENT DIFFERS": `contentFingerprintOf` always
 * returns a digest (a copy with none of the three files hashes the "missing"
 * markers), and that digest is worthless — it would equal the fingerprint of any
 * other empty copy. So the copy is checked first: an unknown / missing /
 * unreadable directory, or a `config/` in which NONE of the three files can be
 * read, is reported as `unavailable` with a reason that says the copy could not
 * be read. The caller must report it as a computation failure, never as a
 * mismatch — the two send the reader hunting for different things.

/**

 *    `node_modules/<name>` from the LIVE install shape. When that shape changed
 *    after the copy was taken, a perfectly good copy was reported as missing:
 *    `dsh-codekg`'s files sat in `node_modules-link/dsh-codekg` while the page
 *    said "the backup has no copy of this plugin". The copy is asked FIRST now
 *    (`backupPluginDirIn`: its own manifest → directory scan → live flag), and
 *    the comparison is repeated only when the first answer was "missing".
 * 2. HOW IT WAS INSTALLED. The page lists hand-written plugins one by one and
 *    merges everything else into two sentences — and those sentences must be
 *    TRUE. A name in the profile's `dependencies` came from npm (its files are
 *    not copied; it is reinstalled), while a bundle that is neither linked nor a
 *    dependency is shipped with DSH itself (nothing to back up).
 *
 * Never throws: an unreadable profile package.json only loses the distinction
 * (everything becomes `builtin`, and the page then says "不需要备份", which is the
 * safe side — it must not claim we have files we do not have).

 * the answer to the one-time question whether the graceful-sleep button is
 * shown, and the settings of the configuration page (how long the countdown
 * runs, whether the pre-restart backup is taken at all and whether that
 * backup includes the installed plugins).
 *
 * It sits next to the health route and uses the same authentication rule
 * (loopback OR a request the connection service admits). Body:
 * `{ "includePlugins"?: boolean, "backupIncludePlugins"?: boolean,
 *   "backupOnRestart"?: boolean, "showSleepButton"?: boolean,
 *   "sleepCountdownSeconds"?: 0 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 60 }` — at least one
 * of the keys must be present, and a key that IS present must carry a valid
 * value. Anything else is refused with a 400 and NOTHING is written.
 *
 * The answer is `{ ok: true, applied: 'config' | 'fallback-file', ... }`:
 * `applied` says where the choice landed — the profile configuration (the
 * official path) or the degraded fallback file. Only the keys that were asked
 * for are echoed back, plus the effective `countdownSeconds` so the settings
 * page can read them back at once.

/**
 * THE ONE-TIME LEFTOVER ROUTE (2026-11-06).
 *
 * The leftovers of an older build are the directories under the backups root
 * that carry no `manifest.json`: a copy that never finished. On the real
 * machine there were 105 of them (23 966 MB), and every restart tried to delete
 * them again.
 *
 * THE USER IS ASKED ONCE, AND THE ANSWER IS FINAL:
 *   - `GET /shell-backups` answers `{ ok, pending, count, bytes, handled }`.
 *     `pending` is true only when there is something to say AND the user has
 *     not dealt with it yet — so a machine without leftovers never sees a card,
 *     and a machine that was answered never sees one again;
 *   - `POST /shell-backups` with `{ "action": "clean" }` deletes the leftovers
 *     (the same code the CLI script runs) and answers with what really
 *     happened, including the reason for every directory that would not go;
 *   - `POST /shell-backups` with `{ "action": "self" }` writes the durable
 *     marker and answers `{ ok: true, handled: true }` — the user takes over
 *     and the question is never asked again, not even after a restart.
 *
 * THERE IS NO SETTINGS ENTRY AND NO PERMANENT BANNER FOR THIS: the problem
 * is a leftover of an old build, and once it is dealt with it must not be a
 * permanent feature of the interface.
 *
 * The route sits next to the health route and uses the same authentication
 * rule (loopback OR a request the connection service admits). A route that
 * changes state only accepts JSON, so a cross-site simple request cannot
 * reach it.
