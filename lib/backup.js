 * kept (older ones are removed so the disk never grows without a limit).
 *
 * The restore path used by the detached helper lives in the generated PowerShell

 * kept elsewhere can be lost, half-written, or keep pointing at a copy that has
 * since been pruned. So the evidence travels in `meta.json`, right next to the

 *
 * THE ROOT CAUSE THIS REPLACES (2026-11-01): `markKnownGood` stamped the
 * PRE-RESTART snapshot unconditionally, with the fixed reason 'boot-ok'. When
 * that boot only came up because a human intervened — or because the watchdog had
 * restored a backup — the state BEFORE the restart was already broken, and it got
 * certified as the safe one anyway. The watchdog then "restored" onto that broken
 * state and the report said everything was fine.
 *
 * Fedora greenboot / RAUC / Android A/B / Kubernetes all agree on the opposite
 * rule: what gets certified is the copy that is RUNNING NOW and was EXPLICITLY
 * CHECKED — never "whatever was lying around before the restart". Windows' Last
 * Known Good is the cautionary tale: after one successful logon the bad
 * configuration had become the LKG, and Microsoft ended up removing the feature.
 *
 * Five sources, so the report can answer "why is this copy considered safe?":
 *   'full-checks'      all four startup checks passed on this exact content;
 *   'command-probe'    the host answered its health route in command mode;
 *   'seed'             the first-install copy (nothing to prove yet, nothing to
 *                      lose either);
 *   'manual-rollback'  a human rolled back and confirmed the result;
 *   'none'             NOT certified. Every meta.json written before this layer

 * fingerprint recorded) — but the two BROKEN configurations stamped by the OLD

 *                        nobody ever certified.

 * SLIM by default — the third-party `node_modules` tree is recorded in the
 * manifest, never copied, so a comparison that walks `<copy>/node_modules` finds
 * nothing and would report "changed" on every single restart. The files a copy
 * really carries are `node_modules-link/<name>` (the editable, linked plugins
 * copied file by file), and their live counterpart is the LINK TARGET inside the
 * profile's `node_modules` — not a directory of the same name under the copy.
 *
 * So the copy decides the list and the profile says where each one is today. A
 * copy that holds no plugin tree is a configuration-only copy and is compared
 * as exactly that.

/**
 * RECORD WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THIS COPY: the boot that followed it, if one did.
 *
 * THE NAME IS HISTORICAL (kept so the call sites and the fixtures that use it keep
 * working): this used to PROMOTE a copy to "known-good" and stamp it as safe. Since
 * 2026-11-02 it records FACTS — when the boot was observed, what looked at it, and
 * whether that boot was running exactly the content the copy holds — and nothing
 * about the plugins inside. "Is this copy good?" is not a question the file
 * answers any more; "did a boot on this content come up?" is.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED AND WHY (2026-11-01): this used to promote unconditionally, with
 * a fixed reason. That is how a bad pre-restart state got certified: the boot
 * only came up because someone intervened, so "the copy from before that boot"
 * was the broken one. A record now requires the caller to say WHAT was observed:
 *
 *   - nothing stated (no legacy `certifiedBy`, no `observedBy`) → NOTHING is
 *     written, the meta is NOT rewritten, and the caller is told why. An old call
 *     site that still says `markKnownGood(dir, { reason: 'boot-ok' })` therefore
 *     degrades into "no boot on record" — the safe direction to fail in (better no
 *     fallback than a false one).
 *   - a real observation (`startup-checks` / `health-probe` / `manual-rollback`,
 *     or the legacy source name that means the same thing) → the facts are
 *     written: when it was observed, what was running, whether the content
 *     matched, and which plugin load failures that boot reported.
 *
 * The CONTENT never changes: "it booted on this content" IS the fact, and it is
 * written where the next rollback looks for it.
 *
 * The startup checks and the health probe are NOT interchangeable — a health probe
 * in command mode proves the process answers; the four startup checks prove the
 * routes, plugins and recovery work. Both are recorded as what they are, because
 * `observedBy` says which one looked.
 *
 * AND THE ANSWER TO "WAS IT THIS CONTENT" TRAVELS WITH IT (2026-11-01): a record
 * states `contentMatched: true` only when the copy's configuration was compared
 * with the one that really booted and the two were equal. A record that says
 * nothing about it still keeps the boot facts — the caller may need them — but the
 * copy is NOT a restore candidate afterwards, because `isCertifiedBackup` needs
 * both halves. Recording the source without the comparison is exactly the shape
 * the two broken configurations on the hosted instance had, so the difference MUST
 * be visible in the meta instead of assumed away.
 *
 * THE ONE THING THIS FUNCTION REFUSES TO DO: erase a comparison that is already on
 * record. `contentMatched` falls back to what the copy carries, so a later
 * promotion that says nothing about it cannot silently un-prove a proven copy.
 * Removing that record is a decision of its own, not a side effect of re-writing
 * the same file.

/**
 * MAY THIS COPY BE PUT BACK BY THE SYSTEM? (2026-11-02 - the ONE answer)
 *
 * TWO CALLERS USED TO DISAGREE, and this function exists to stop that:
 * `selectRestoreTarget` (the watchdog) read `boot.started && boot.contentMatched`,
 * while `latestKnownGood` (single-plugin recovery) read `kind === 'known-good'`
 * plus `restoreEligible` - two rulers over the same directory, so the same copy
 * could be "a restore point" to one path and "not a restore point" to the other.
 * A copy that one path would roll back to and the other would refuse is a bug the
 * user pays for at the worst possible moment.
 *
 * THE CRITERION IS RECORDED FACTS ONLY - never a stamp, never a verdict:
 *   - `boot.started === true`        the instance came up after this copy was taken;
 *   - `boot.contentMatched === true` what came up was this copy's content;
 *   - no rescue was needed (`intervention`), because a copy whose own boot had to
 *     be rescued has already shown it does not come up on its own.
 *
 * ON `intervention === null` (nobody recorded it): the contract names
 * `intervention !== true` as the bound, and this reads it the strict way - a
 * missing record is not a licence, it is `intervention-unrecorded`. That is the
 * reading the watchdog has always had and the one its tests pin; the other way
 * would mean the system restores what it could not check.
 *
 * OLD RECORDS: `readBackupMeta` translates a pre-boot record into the facts it
 * described (`legacyBootFactsOf`), so an old copy is judged by what its record
 * says - and a record that claims a check but carries no boot fact stays out.

 * between files whether it should stop.
 *
 * IT YIELDS TO THE EVENT LOOP on purpose: the copy runs inside the host
 * process, and a copy that never yields blocks the very route the "cancel"
 * button posts to — the user could not call it off even though the code says
 * they can. Every `yieldEveryFiles` files (and every `yieldEveryMs`

 *     would protect exactly the copy nobody may restore.
 *  2. NO CERTIFIED COPY AT ALL → NOTHING IS REMOVED. This is the strict-mode
 *     decision: disk space is cheaper than deleting the only copy that might
 *     still come in handy, and the caller has to be able to tell the customer
 *     "there is no trusted restore point". The answer says so (`skipped`), so
 *     the upper layer can say it out loud instead of quietly doing nothing.
 *  3. The pre-existing floors stay as they were: the newest known-good copy and
 *     the oldest copy are never victims.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT: it is not "keep only the newest copy" and it is not a
 * smarter policy — it is a floor under the existing one.

    // actually happened, not from an adjective it awarded itself.
    //
    // So there are exactly two keepers, both facts:
    //   1. the NEWEST copy — the one this restart just wrote; deleting it is how
    //      the 2026-11-02 report happened at all (that is pinned by a test);
    //   2. the newest copy whose restart record says the instance CAME UP and the
    //      content MATCHED (`boot.started` + `boot.contentMatched`) — the one copy
    //      a failed boot can honestly fall back to.
    // The previous "last certified one" protection is GONE: it kept a copy alive
    // because of a label, and a label is not a reason to spend disk.
    //
    // A COPY WITH NO `meta.json` HAS NO FACTS AT ALL (2026-11-02): the real hosted
    // machine had two such directories; `metas.get(name)` returned null and the
    // old code read `null.kind`, which threw and killed the whole prune. A meta
    // that cannot be read is simply "not the booted copy".
    const bootedName = (() => {
      // ONLY A REAL COPY CAN HOLD THIS SLOT: a directory without a manifest is
      // not a point in time, so it cannot be the copy a failed boot falls back
      // to.

    // looked when this machine was still fine" reference, and losing it is what
    // made the comparison against a backup meaningless after three restarts.
    //
    // BUT IT IS A PREFERENCE, NOT A PROTECTION (2026-11-02). Two facts forced
    // that: (a) the newest copy must never be the victim — on the real machine it
    // was the ONLY unprotected candidate, so "trim to the limit" deleted the
    // snapshot the restart had just written while a 0.1 MB leftover survived;
    // (b) keeping the oldest copy absolutely makes the list unable to converge at
    // all when oldest, booted and newest are three different copies — exactly the
    // real machine, which would then never get back to `maxBackups`.
    //
    // THE FIRST-INSTALL COPY IS A PREFERENCE OF THE SAME WEIGHT (2026-11-02): it
    // used to be kept forever because its meta said `certifiedBy: 'seed'`. It is
    // the only copy of "what the machine looked like before anything happened",
    // so it is worth sparing — but only while there is room, exactly like the
    // oldest one. Nothing is kept forever on the strength of a label.
    //
    // A rollback that is IN PROGRESS is protected another way: its undo copy is
    // written with `pruneEnabled: false`, so no prune can touch the copy being
    // restored.
    const oldestName = copies.length > 0 ? copies[0] : null
    // THE "NEWEST COPY" SLOT IS NOT "WHATEVER SORTS LAST" (2026-11-06).
    //
    // The old rule took `names[names.length - 1]` — the last directory name in
    // alphabetical order. The first-install seed is written AFTER the copy the
    // restart took (the seed is taken when the plugin first runs, the snapshot
    // when the restart is scheduled), so on a machine that has both the SEED
    // sorts last, took the "the newest copy is never a victim" slot, and the
    // real restart snapshot became a deletion candidate. The restart then threw
    // away its own rollback point and kept the seed.
    //
    // THE SEED MAY NOT HOLD THE SLOT. The slot goes to the NEWEST COMPLETE COPY
    // THAT IS NOT THE SEED — which is the copy the restart took
    // (`trigger: 'pre-restart'`) whenever the seed is the newest thing on disk,
    // and the newest copy in every other case.
    //
    // WHY NOT "ONLY A `pre-restart` COPY" (and this is the whole rule): a copy
    // written by an older build carries no trigger at all, and a rule that only
    // looked at `pre-restart` copies handed the slot to an OLDER copy and let
    // the actual newest one be deleted — the very thing the slot exists to

 * LINKED PLUGINS WERE NEVER RESTORED (real machine, 2026-11-07 — the "回退 did

 * `node_modules-link/<name>`, and this function only ever looked at

 * symbolic links into the workspace, so `backup/node_modules` did not exist at
 * all: the receipt said `restored: [cordis.patch.yml, package.json,
 * pnpm-lock.yaml]` — three files, zero plugins — and a probe comment that WAS in
 * the copy (14,143 bytes, sha1 21FEC7F7) never came back (the file stayed at
 * 14,067 bytes, sha1 8108BA5D). A backup that cannot bring a plugin back is not
 * a backup.
 *
 * THE LANDING SPOT IS THE LINK'S REAL TARGET, not the link: overwriting the
 * symlink itself would destroy the install shape, and the workspace directory
 * behind it is where the code actually lives. What is written is per-file
 * overwrite and nothing else — `.git` and every file the backup does not hold
 * are left exactly where they are (the target is a git checkout; deleting

 *
 * WHAT IS A VICTIM, EXACTLY: a directory that has NO `manifest.json` **AND** no
 * configuration file, that is older than `minAgeMs` (a copy being written right
 * now is left alone) and is not a dot entry. A manifest alone is enough to keep
 * a directory: a copy that only lacks `meta.json` predates it and is restorable.
 *
 * WHY THE CONFIGURATION NO LONGER SAVES A DIRECTORY (user decision, 2026-11-02):
 * the real machine kept producing directories that copied the whole plugin tree
 * (~150 MB, hundreds of files) and died before writing the manifest. They have a
 * configuration file, so the old rule spared them, and nothing could ever restore
 * from them. Without a manifest a directory is not a point in time — it is the
 * wreck of one — so the manifest is the only thing that decides, and anything
 * else is deleted once it is old enough.
 *
 * WHAT IS NEVER TOUCHED:
 *   - anything starting with `.` — that is `.staging-<stamp>`, a backup being
 *     written right now; deleting it would corrupt a concurrent backup;
 *   - anything that would pass `backupIsComplete`;
 *   - anything that is not a directory.
 *
 * BUDGET: a hard ceiling on both the number of directories and the bytes per
 * call (32 dirs / 2 GB by default). Once the ceiling is reached the rest is only
 * COUNTED (`skipped`) and reported — a boot path must never decide to delete an
 * unbounded amount of the user's disk.
