/**
 * dsh-autorestart — durable checkpoint store.
 *
 * Keeps one small JSON document in the DSH home directory that describes what
 * the host was doing when it stopped: the current boot identity, the restart
 * generation, and one entry per agent session that may need to be resumed.
 *
 * Design rules:
 *  - never throw while *reading*: a missing, unreadable or corrupt state file
 *    is reported and replaced by `createEmptyState()`.
 *  - never leave a half-written file: writes go to `<file>.tmp-<rand>` in the
 *    same directory and are then atomically renamed over the target.
 *  - every mutating helper below mutates `state` in place **and** returns it,
 *    so callers may treat the helpers as expressions.
 *
 * Goal records come in TWO shapes on purpose:
 *  - `state.disarmedGoals[sessionId] = { goalId, disarmedAt, resumedAt }` is the
 *    current shape: this plugin called `ctx.goals.disarm(agent)` before a
 *    restart, which keeps the durable goal `active` and can be re-armed with
 *    `ctx.goals.resume(...)` after the boot.
 *  - `state.parkedGoals[sessionId] = { goalId, parkedAt, resumedAt }` is the
 *    LEGACY shape written by the previous pause-based build. It is still read
 *    (and can still be cleared) so a goal that build paused is resumed once
 *    instead of being stranded in `paused` where only a human could undo it.
 *
 * ESM only, Node builtins only. No DSH / npm imports (profile-installed
 * bundles may not resolve them).

 * pass only looks at sessions that ALREADY carry `pendingResume`, and disarming
 * a goal for the restart never sets one — so a goal that was taken away was
 * never given back: that session sat idle with its goal disarmed, and
 * `recover_now` answered `no-pending-recovery` because nothing was pending.
 *
 * The disarmed/parked records are written BEFORE the restart and survive it, so
 * they are exactly the list of work that still has to happen. Only records from
 * THIS restart are adopted, so history from days ago cannot resurrect a
 * session that is long done.
 *
 * WHICH RECORDS BELONG TO THIS RESTART (bug, 2026-11-12). The test used to be
 * "the record is not older than the request" — a comparison with
 * `restart.requestedAt`, a field that every later requester rewrites (and
 * that `defer_seconds` pushes into the future). A disarm that happened BEFORE
 * the second requester therefore looked like history, was never adopted, and
 * the goal was never given back after the restart. The ownership now decides:
 * a record that names a restart (`reason`) belongs to that restart, whatever
 * the REQUEST's clock says — the age bound is the one exception (it is about
 * HOW LONG AGO the disarm happened, not about WHICH restart it was). A record
 * of the previous build has no reason, so the timestamps are all it has — the
 * request moment (the start of the cycle) and an age bound, which keeps a
 * never-resumed record from coming back for ever.
 *
 * A GOAL THE USER STOPPED IS NOT ADOPTED (bug, 2026-11-11). `continuum_park_goal`
 * leaves a disarm record; if the user then PAUSES that goal, the record is
 * stale: adopting it would queue a continuation message and WAKE the session
 * the user deliberately silenced. The state of the goal is therefore part of
 * the guard: a goal whose phase is `paused` or `blocked` (or whose activation
