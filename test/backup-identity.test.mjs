/**
 * THE IDENTITY OF A BACKUP — the library half of the 2026-10-30 backup
 * semantics (lib/backup.js only; nothing here drives a restart).
 *
 * WHY (user report, 2026-10-30): a pre-restart snapshot is taken BEFORE the
 * restart, i.e. it holds exactly the state that is about to be tested — the
 * state that may be what breaks the boot. Rolling a broken host back onto such
 * a copy would restore the very thing that failed. So every copy carries an
 * identity in `meta.json`:
 *
 *   'snapshot'    taken before a restart, NOT proven;
 *   'known-good'  a restart with this content really came up;
 *   'unknown'     no meta.json (written before this rule) — never used
 *                 automatically.
 *
 * What is pinned here:
 *   1. `DEFAULT_MAX_BACKUPS` is 3 (the current copy plus the two before it);
 *   2. pruning still throws away the OLDEST copies when the limit is exceeded;
 *   3. pruning NEVER throws away the newest known-good copy — not even when it
 *      is the oldest one on disk;
 *   4. a copy without a meta.json reads as 'unknown' and is never the answer of
 *      `latestKnownGood`;
 *   5. `markKnownGood` promotes a copy (keeping its version) and makes it the
 *      `latestKnownGood`;
 *   6. `createBackup` writes the identity (default `'snapshot'`) and accepts the
 *      other two kinds.
