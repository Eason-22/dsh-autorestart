/**
 * A GOAL A RESTART DISARMED MUST BE GIVEN BACK (bug, 2026-11-11).
 *
 * User, verbatim: "刚刚重启的时候，这个目标没有被触发继续". The boot pass only
 * looks at sessions that already carry `pendingResume`; disarming a goal for the
 * restart never set one, so the session sat idle with its goal disarmed and
 * `recover_now` answered `no-pending-recovery`.
 *
 * The disarmed/parked records are written BEFORE the restart and survive it, so
 * `recoverableSessions` now adopts the ones from THIS restart before it looks
 * for pending work. These tests pin that, without a host and without a restart.
